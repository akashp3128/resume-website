# Real-time Stock Ticker Implementation

This is an improved implementation of the stock ticker that fetches real-time or most recent market data from free public APIs.

## Features

- Fetches real-time stock data from Yahoo Finance API
- Fetches crypto data from CoinGecko API
- No API keys required for basic functionality
- Built-in fallback mechanism with realistic mock data
- Smooth scrolling ticker animation
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Automatic development/production environment detection

## Technical Details

### API Sources

1. **Yahoo Finance API (Unofficial)**
   - Used for stock data
   - Endpoint: `https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v8/finance/chart/SYMBOL?interval=1d`
   - No rate limits for basic usage
   - No API key required

2. **CoinGecko API**
   - Used for cryptocurrency data
   - Endpoint: `https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=ID&vs_currencies=usd&include_24hr_change=true`
   - Free tier: 50 calls/minute
   - No API key required for basic usage

### Files Included

- `public/js/realtime-stock-ticker.js` - The real-time ticker implementation
- `realtime-ticker.html` - A standalone test page with console logging
- `run-realtime-ticker.sh` - Script to run a local server for testing

## Testing the Ticker

1. Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   ./run-realtime-ticker.sh
   ```

2. Visit http://localhost:8000/realtime-ticker.html in your browser

3. The test page includes:
   - The ticker with real-time data
   - Console output for debugging
   - Control buttons to test different scenarios

## Integration

To integrate this ticker into the main website:

1. Replace the reference to the old ticker script with the new one:
   ```html
   <!-- Change this -->
   <script src="public/js/isolated-stock-ticker.js"></script>
   
   <!-- To this -->
   <script src="public/js/realtime-stock-ticker.js"></script>
   ```

2. The HTML container structure and CSS remain the same, so no other changes are needed.

## Customization

- To change which stocks are displayed, modify the `STOCK_SYMBOLS` array in `realtime-stock-ticker.js`
- To change which cryptocurrencies are displayed, modify the `CRYPTO_SYMBOLS` object
- The refresh interval is set to 2 minutes in production and 30 seconds in development

## Fallback Behavior

If the APIs fail to return valid data after 3 consecutive attempts, the ticker will enter fallback mode. In this mode:

1. The ticker will display mock data based on real market values
2. Values will be randomly adjusted every refresh to simulate market movement
3. The ticker will periodically attempt to reconnect to the real APIs

## Browser Compatibility
